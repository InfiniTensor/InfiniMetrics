## 🎯 Overview

**InfiniMetrics** provides standardized interfaces for benchmarking across multiple layers:

- **Hardware-Level**: GPU memory bandwidth, cache performance, compute capabilities
- **Operator-Level**: Individual operation performance (FLOPS, latency)
- **Inference-Level**: End-to-end model inference throughput and latency
- **Communication-Level**: NCCL collective operations and inter-GPU communication

### Key Features

- **Unified Adapter Interface** - Consistent API across all test types and frameworks
- **Extensible Architecture** - Easy to add new test types, frameworks, and metrics
- **Comprehensive Metrics** - Scalar values, time-series data, custom measurements
- **Framework Agnostic** - Support for InfiniLM, vLLM, InfiniCore, and more
- **Production Ready** - Robust error handling, logging, and result aggregation
